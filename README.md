3. Note down the COM port assigned to your ESP32

### Software Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rakshitbharat/esp32-virtual-keyboard-mouse-combo.git
```

2. Install required libraries in Arduino IDE
3. Configure your ESP32 board in Arduino IDE
4. Upload the firmware to your ESP32

### Mobile App Setup

1. Download the mobile app from releases
2. Enable Bluetooth on your smartphone
3. Connect to the ESP32 device
4. Follow the in-app setup instructions

## üì° How It Works

1. **Initial Setup**: Connect ESP32 to PC/Laptop via USB for programming
2. **Configuration**: ESP32 is configured with both WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities
3. **Connection**: Mobile app connects to ESP32 via Bluetooth
4. **Control**: Use the mobile app interface to:

# ESP32 Bluetooth LE Keyboard-Mouse Combo

This project implements a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) keyboard and mouse combo using an ESP32 microcontroller. It allows you to create a wireless input device that can be connected to computers, tablets, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices.

## Required Libraries

This project depends on the following libraries:

1. [ESP32-BLE-Keyboard](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard) - For BLE keyboard functionality
2. [ESP32-BLE-Mouse](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Mouse) - For BLE mouse functionality
3. [ESP32-BLE-Gamepad](https://github.com/lemmingDev/ESP32-BLE-Gamepad) - For additional gamepad functionality (optional)

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- Input components (buttons, joystick, etc.) based on your specific implementation
- Power supply (USB or battery)

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the Arduino IDE
2. Add ESP32 board support to Arduino IDE:
   - Open Arduino IDE
   - Go to File > Preferences
   - Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json` to Additional Board Manager URLs
   - Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager
   - Search for ESP32 and install

3. Install Required Libraries:
   - Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries
   - Search for and install the required libraries listed above

4. Configure Board Settings:
   - Select your ESP32 board from Tools > Board
   - Select the appropriate port from Tools > Port

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE
3. Configure your input pins in the code
4. Upload the code to your ESP32
5. The device will appear as a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse in your device's Bluetooth settings
6. Connect to the device and start using it
